The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":7}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ln14XjAc1HZq","colab_type":"text"},"source":["It contains one line per review, with the label ('negative' or 'positive'), the text and a flag to determine if it should be part of the validation set or the training set.

film . xxmaj does it work ? xxmaj yes . xxmaj xxunk runs for mayor and gets shot . xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk \" hall of fame \" turns up . xxmaj xxunk and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series . a lot of flashbacks helps you who xxunk seen the xxup tv - series but it xxunk the fans too . xxmaj the last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up . xxmaj and a short appearance from my favourite xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj cox . xxmaj this is a good film .,xxbos xxmaj after xxunk myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies xxunk on ex - rental dvds , i figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than xxmaj sam xxmaj mendes ? xxmaj for a number of reasons , \" xxmaj american xxmaj beauty \" does n't appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the xxunk thing that xxmaj tom xxmaj hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade . xxmaj for this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins , and is simply wonderful to watch because of it . xxmaj and despite my usual xxunk to any film with xxmaj tom xxmaj hanks ' name on it ( still ca n't watch \" xxmaj big \" without wanting a cat to kick ) , i 'm glad i gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you 'll kick yourself for if you miss it . \n"," \n","  xxmaj normally squeaky -

man ( a menacing xxmaj xxunk xxmaj law ) is waiting for them . \n"," \n","  xxmaj on the face of it , it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as i 've said , this is n't really about gangsters at all . xxmaj it 's about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances . xxmaj hanks is ( * grits teeth * ) superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little xxmaj hoechlin is also good as xxmaj sullivan 's son . xxmaj in all honesty , there is not a single performance that i could single out as weaker than the others - the cast is pretty much faultless . xxmaj as is the cinematography and costumes ( and it 's not often i praise costumes ! ) which xxunk the 30 's with stunning effect . xxmaj there has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades . xxmaj this could easily have looked rubbish - they admit that the early 30 's look was difficult to put down - but it does n't and that deserves every bit of credit . xxmaj chicago especially looks fantastic , xxunk with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and xxunk . xxmaj true time - travel , even if a little xxup cgi is needed . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the story is also a winner , offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain . xxmaj law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer xxmaj maguire and proves that you do n't have to be xxmaj cagney or xxmaj de xxmaj niro or xxmaj brando to play a gangster . xxmaj the film is decidedly noir - ish , driving rain and ill - lit xxunk xxunk but at least violence and killing are ( finally ) seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who xxunk and those who merely witness such acts . xxmaj the whole thing is xxunk of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and xxunk with a modern tale of redemption amid the xxmaj tommy - xxmaj gun xxunk and xxunk xxunk . xxmaj it can feel a little slow in places , especially if you 're used to masses of gun - play in movies like most modern audiences ( like yours truly ) but sometimes , words can speak xxunk than actions . xxmaj mendes has delivered a fine follow - up to his xxmaj oscar - winning debut , a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch . \" xxmaj road xxmaj to xxmaj perdition \" may not be to everyone 's tastes but this is one xxup dvd i shall not be exchanging anytime soon .,xxbos xxmaj this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen , the poor special effects along with the poor acting are just a few of the things wrong with this film . i am fan of the first two major xxunk but this one is lame !\n","y: CategoryList\n","positive,negative,positive,positive,negative\n","Path: /root/.fastai/data/imdb_sample;\n","\n","Valid: LabelList (201 items)\n","x: TextList\n","xxbos i managed to grab a viewing of this with the aid of xxup mst3 k , and oh boy , even with the xxunk this movie was excruciatingly bad . xxmaj imagine someone whose xxunk with a camera could be out done by a xxunk . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the highlights ( what little there were ) came from the special effects , which were \" xxup ok \" . xxmaj the acting for the most part was also \" xxup ok \" ; though nothing special , it was of a higher quality than other b -

motion which makes it less violent and watchable for young children ( age limit 6 in xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk ) . xxmaj no blood is shed . xxmaj some scenes ( xxunk born animals ) are really cute and will be adored by kids . xxmaj it looks like an ordinary nature film but when you know how many shooting days it took ( xxunk ) and how much money it has cost it becomes an even more astonishing piece of beauty . xxmaj it had it 's xxmaj dutch premiere yesterday , a month before the actual release , in a cinema of xxunk xxunk , of which 15 were taken . xxmaj true beauty is rarely interesting for cinema goers , it seems . xxmaj as i knew the xxup tv - series i was of course very curious if my favourite scenes would make it into this movie . xxmaj some did n't , but the most impressive shots ( big xxunk ) did , luckily . xxmaj it was the first time i ever xxunk in a nature film .,xxbos xxmaj for those who like their murder xxunk busy , this is definitely the one to see , as it is chock full of interesting and suspicious characters , most of them wealthy xxmaj long xxmaj island xxunk types . xxmaj as the star detective , xxmaj william xxmaj powell is alternately xxunk and inspired , behaving at times as if he and his suit went to the xxunk and got pressed together . xxmaj mary xxmaj astor is very lovely here . \n"," \n","  xxmaj powell had made a career out of playing the lead character , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj vance , in a series of movies made at a couple of studios over several years . xxmaj in -

and dried case of suicide he has good reason to suspect is really something much more , a rather deliciously complex murder ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj as far as murder mystery films go , it just does n't get any better than this one . xxmaj populated with suspicious characters , all connected to a dog show and all having very good reason to murder the apparent suicide victim xxmaj archer xxmaj coe , it 's truly tough to figure this one out or wrap one 's head around it but boy , does it proves fascinating to watch unfold before us . xxmaj even the cops , the coroner and the district attorney prove colorful , fleshed out characters adding a level of unexpected gritty realism to this one 's proceedings and amping up its overall \" fun \" factor . i particularly enjoyed the comic scenes involving the coroner ( played by xxmaj etienne xxmaj girardot ) , who is always it seems to him being rudely and untimely interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during this one 's running time . xxmaj also xxmaj eugene xxmaj palette 's xxmaj detective xxmaj sgt . xxmaj heath provides welcome , often later delightfully humorous at his expense , critical commentary during xxmaj vance 's investigation . i can not think of any valid criticism to give this movie in fact except perhaps that it has n't dated particularly well . xxmaj does n't stop the movie from being just plain good fun viewing though . xxmaj watch and see if you can wrap your head around this one 's mystery . xxmaj highly recommended you try !,xxbos xxmaj rock ' n ' xxmaj roll xxmaj high xxmaj school was one of the best movies ever made ! i think the only reason it was so awesome was because of xxmaj the xxmaj ramones ! xxmaj you could n't have made the same movie and put something like the xxmaj sex xxmaj pistols , or xxmaj the xxmaj clash in place of xxmaj the xxmaj ramones , it just would n't have been the same . dey young , clint howard , xxmaj vincent xxmaj van xxmaj patten , xxmaj mary xxmaj woronov , xxmaj paul xxmaj bartel , and the hall xxunk , just added to the movie . xxmaj the whole entire movie is about xxmaj the xxmaj ramones ... especially xxmaj joey ! xxmaj so everybody showed see xxmaj rock ' n ' xxmaj roll xxmaj high xxmaj school if your a huge fan of real xxup punk . xxmaj not the sissy new crap ... but the loud , and fast kind . xxmaj the kind only xxmaj the xxmaj ramones could do . xxup r.i.p ( xxmaj rest xxmaj in xxmaj peace ) xxmaj joey xxmaj ramone 1951 - 2001 . xxmaj dee xxmaj dee xxmaj ramone 1952 - 2002 !,xxbos xxmaj karloff and xxmaj lugosi - xxmaj together again ! xxmaj this is one of those films that casual fans will pass over and tend not to appreciate as much . xxmaj it 's not an all - out horror film like the duo 's previous two hits , xxmaj the xxmaj black xxmaj cat and xxmaj the xxmaj raven . xxmaj but , it is very worthy of both 's talents and is a fun film when re - visited . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the xxmaj invisible xxmaj ray was directed by xxmaj lambert xxmaj hillyer , a director who mainly made westerns , but curiously in these final days of the xxmaj xxunk ' reign at xxmaj universal , he found himself helming this and the xxmaj xxunk ' final horror film , xxmaj dracula 's xxmaj daughter . xxmaj both are crisp , clean - cut fantasies that are very light on horror content despite the fantastic elements . \n"," \n","  xxmaj just as xxmaj lugosi went wild in xxmaj the xxmaj raven , much needs to be said of xxmaj karloff 's hamming in xxmaj the xxmaj invisible xxmaj ray . xxmaj the one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfying is that xxmaj karloff 's character , xxmaj rukh , acts so madly before he is poisoned by xxmaj radium x , that there really is n't much of a change once he starts glowing . xxmaj this is very similar to the complaint people have about xxmaj jack xxmaj nicholson in xxmaj the xxmaj shining - xxmaj he 's basically a loony right from the start . xxmaj there is n't any real transformation . xxmaj same here . xxmaj halfway through xxmaj karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind . i still enjoyed his performance , though , just as i did xxmaj lugosi 's over - the - top antics in xxmaj the xxmaj raven . \n"," \n","  xxmaj meanwhile , xxmaj lugosi completely surprises you and gives a restrained , and thoughtful turn as xxmaj rukh 's rival in science , xxmaj dr. xxmaj benet . xxmaj lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film , including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch xxmaj rukh , of which i am in alignment with horror film writer xxmaj john xxmaj xxunk on - \" xxmaj and if he ( xxmaj rukh ) touches anyone ? \" the inspector inquires . xxmaj lugosi xxunk replies , in a way that only xxmaj lugosi could deliver , \" xxmaj they die \" . xxmaj just as xxmaj lugosi could be so off , he could also be more perfect than any actor . xxmaj this is one of those moments . \n"," \n","  xxmaj therefore , xxmaj karloff and xxmaj lugosi 's interactions are all very good as we get the mad antics of xxmaj karloff pared off against the cool logic of xxmaj lugosi . xxmaj karloff would go on to play similar mad scientists many times , however , one wishes xxmaj lugosi would have gotten to play more straight roles like this one . xxmaj he only had one more chance ( xxmaj ninotchka ) . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the xxmaj invisible xxmaj ray is a fun film , and a real treat to the true xxmaj karloff and xxmaj lugosi fans . xxmaj it is one of those films that improves on each viewing , not because it is a masterpiece , but because of the charisma and talent of its ' stars and how this story complements the darker , more horrific pairings they had . xxmaj the special effects , by the always innovative xxmaj john xxmaj fulton , are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate . xxmaj frances xxmaj drake looks as beautiful as she did in xxmaj mad xxmaj love and plays a strong woman , something seldom seen in classic horror films . xxmaj the scene in the end when xxmaj karloff stalks her and she does n't scream is one of the most haunting moments of the film . a terrific , fun film !,xxbos xxmaj leave it to xxmaj xxunk to put on a good show . xxmaj finally he and xxmaj zorak are living their own lives outside of xxmaj xxunk xxmaj ghost xxmaj coast xxmaj to xxmaj coast . i have to say that i love both of these shows a whole lot . xxmaj they are completely what started xxmaj adult xxmaj swim . xxmaj brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000 . xxmaj it may not have been platinum , but his show was really popular to tons of people out there that love xxmaj adult xxmaj swims shows . i have to say that out of all the xxmaj adult xxmaj swim shows with no plot , this has to be the one with the most none plot ever made . xxmaj that is why i like it so much , it is just such a classic in the xxmaj adult xxmaj swim history . i believe this is just such a great show , if you do n't like it . xxmaj hey there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it .,xxbos this is the best sci - fi that i have seen in my 29 years of watching sci - fi . i also believe that xxmaj dark xxmaj

second , third and who knows how many more episodes ! xxmaj its a really good show , very funny and entertaining !,xxbos xxmaj jennifer xxmaj montgomery 's \" xxmaj art for xxmaj teachers of xxmaj children \" is a stunning , disturbing masterpiece . xxmaj montgomery 's gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking , raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year - old xxmaj jennifer 's seduction of her married boarding - school guidance counselor . xxmaj the scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing xxmaj jennifer ( xxmaj caitlin xxmaj grace mcdonnell ) and xxmaj jennifer 's mother ( actually voiced by xxmaj ruth xxmaj montgomery ) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful i 've ever seen captured on film . xxmaj the lesson ultimately learned here ? \" xxmaj there 's nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art . \" xxmaj well , i would highly recommend this remarkable piece of \" xxmaj art \" for anyone interested in thought - provoking independent cinema .,xxbos xxmaj perhaps one of the first slasher film that came out after xxmaj halloween ( xxmaj although made from xxmaj irwin xxmaj xxunk from xxmaj halloween ) , i must say i honestly found \" xxmaj tourist xxmaj trap \" to be scarier and funner . \" xxmaj tourist xxmaj trap \" is one of those remarkable treats you find every now and then , and are left with the most enjoyable feeling of surprise . xxmaj it was destiny i tell you , but one night i was at my local xxmaj blockbuster ( xxmaj one or xxmaj two months before it went out of business ) , and had nothing to get . xxmaj then i stumble upon this movie , i think huh seems like a laughable b - xxmaj movie , i rent it and took it home , boy was i in for a good scare . \" xxmaj tourist xxmaj trap \" comes off as a bad movie , it definitely has it 's cheesy moments , but in the end you 're having to much fun with it to really care . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the things that impressed me the absolute most , and the things that made this movie one of the scariest ones i 've seen , is number one the setting . a horror movie without a good setting is n't very fun , not here . i just love love love the location , it feels like we can relate to it , it almost feels like we 've been there before . xxmaj which makes it creepier . xxmaj next is the characters , non of them are really stereotypical , and they all have a real personality . xxmaj for example they 're not stoners , alcoholics , or even xxmaj sex obsessed people , they feel like normal young adults . xxmaj plus they look realistic enough , and then their is xxmaj chuck xxmaj connors . xxmaj who gives a great performance as xxmaj mr. xxmaj slausen who we all take an instant liking too because again he 's so real , he feels like that nice guy grandfatherly figure we adore . xxmaj the last , and probably most important thing that makes this movie scary is how they make us ( the audience ) jump half way out of our seats , and turn on the rights , for the right reasons . xxmaj for example most of the time in horror films we mainly just jump because of a sudden change in the music pitch , but in \" xxmaj tourist xxmaj trap \" prepare yourself , that 's not the case . xxmaj with it 's perfect use of lighting , mannequins , and weirdness you feel utterly creeped out . xxmaj plus i love because although they may go a bit over - the - top with some things you still feel like this could happen . xxmaj which is exactly what a horror movie who takes such a ridicules premise should do , and that is make us ( the audience ) feel unsafe and terrified . \n"," \n","  xxmaj overall as far as any major problems go , i have none , only that it 's weirdness may get a little too weird at times . xxmaj however in the end \" xxmaj tourist xxmaj trap \" holds a place near and dear to my heart , for being one of the few horror films to make me turn on the lights and feel unsafe about traveling .,xxbos xxmaj ca n't say this was n't made well . xxmaj at a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes . xxmaj and there is n't the slightest indication he did n't get exactly what he wanted . xxmaj but this is an oddly non - xxmaj hispanic film in the same way xxmaj west xxmaj side xxmaj story was many years ago . xxmaj both the leads , a brother - sister team , are excellent and memorable in their parts . xxmaj the setting , a sort of underground car repair district in xxmaj queens , is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself . xxmaj but there 's something unsatisfying about the key issue in the film , namely , what the sister feels she has to do to get by . i can understand the brother 's reaction , but it just seems a little too easily come by to me . xxmaj the movie seems to suggest that people like these do n't need our help , that they 'll find a way to survive without the usual support systems . i would n't encourage anyone to believe that . xxmaj there would be far more resistance to the choices made here than depicted . xxmaj other than that as an entertainment it works well . xxmaj as an accurate depiction of a culture , not so well , i think .\n","y: CategoryList\n","pos,pos,pos,pos,pos\n","Path: /content/data/imdb;\n","\n","Test:

his overseas trip to investigate an apparently cut and dried case of suicide he has good reason to suspect is really something much more , a rather deliciously complex murder ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj as far as murder mystery films go , it just does n't get any better than this one . xxmaj populated with suspicious characters , all connected to a dog show and all having very good reason to murder the apparent suicide victim xxmaj archer xxmaj coe , it 's truly tough to figure this one out or wrap one 's head around it but boy , does it proves fascinating to watch unfold before us . xxmaj even the cops , the coroner and the district attorney prove colorful , fleshed out characters adding a level of unexpected gritty realism to this one 's proceedings and amping up its overall \" fun \" factor . i particularly enjoyed the comic scenes involving the coroner ( played by xxmaj etienne xxmaj girardot ) , who is always it seems to him being rudely and untimely interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during this one 's running time . xxmaj also xxmaj eugene xxmaj palette 's xxmaj detective xxmaj sgt . xxmaj heath provides welcome , often later delightfully humorous at his expense , critical commentary during xxmaj vance 's investigation . i can not think of any valid criticism to give this movie in fact except perhaps that it has n't dated particularly well . xxmaj does n't stop the movie from being just plain good fun viewing though . xxmaj watch and see if you can wrap your head around this one 's mystery . xxmaj highly recommended you try !,xxbos xxmaj rock ' n ' xxmaj roll xxmaj high xxmaj school was one of the best movies ever made ! i think the only reason it was so awesome was because of xxmaj the xxmaj ramones ! xxmaj you could n't have made the same movie and put something like the xxmaj sex xxmaj pistols , or xxmaj the xxmaj clash in place of xxmaj the xxmaj ramones , it just would n't have been the same . dey young , clint howard , xxmaj vincent xxmaj van xxmaj patten , xxmaj mary xxmaj woronov , xxmaj paul xxmaj bartel , and the hall xxunk , just added to the movie . xxmaj the whole entire movie is about xxmaj the xxmaj ramones ... especially xxmaj joey ! xxmaj so everybody showed see xxmaj rock ' n ' xxmaj roll xxmaj high xxmaj school if your a huge fan of real xxup punk . xxmaj not the sissy new crap ... but the loud , and fast kind . xxmaj the kind only xxmaj the xxmaj ramones could do . xxup r.i.p ( xxmaj rest xxmaj in xxmaj peace ) xxmaj joey xxmaj ramone 1951 - 2001 . xxmaj dee xxmaj dee xxmaj ramone 1952 - 2002 !,xxbos xxmaj karloff and xxmaj lugosi - xxmaj together again ! xxmaj this is one of those films that casual fans will pass over and tend not to appreciate as much . xxmaj it 's not an all - out horror film like the duo 's previous two hits , xxmaj the xxmaj black xxmaj cat and xxmaj the xxmaj raven . xxmaj but , it is very worthy of both 's talents and is a fun film when re - visited . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the xxmaj invisible xxmaj ray was directed by xxmaj lambert xxmaj hillyer , a director who mainly made westerns , but curiously in these final days of the xxmaj xxunk ' reign at xxmaj universal , he found himself helming this and the xxmaj xxunk ' final horror film , xxmaj dracula 's xxmaj daughter . xxmaj both are crisp , clean - cut fantasies that are very light on horror content despite the fantastic elements . \n"," \n","  xxmaj just as xxmaj lugosi went wild in xxmaj the xxmaj raven , much needs to be said of xxmaj karloff 's hamming in xxmaj the xxmaj invisible xxmaj ray . xxmaj the one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfying is that xxmaj karloff 's character , xxmaj rukh , acts so madly before he is poisoned by xxmaj radium x , that there really is n't much of a change once he starts glowing . xxmaj this is very similar to the complaint people have about xxmaj jack xxmaj nicholson in xxmaj the xxmaj shining - xxmaj he 's basically a loony right from the start . xxmaj there is n't any real transformation . xxmaj same here . xxmaj halfway through xxmaj karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind . i still enjoyed his performance , though , just as i did xxmaj lugosi 's over - the - top antics in xxmaj the xxmaj raven . \n"," \n","  xxmaj meanwhile , xxmaj lugosi completely surprises you and gives a restrained , and thoughtful turn as xxmaj rukh 's rival in science , xxmaj dr. xxmaj benet . xxmaj lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film , including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch xxmaj rukh , of which i am in alignment with horror film writer xxmaj john xxmaj xxunk on - \" xxmaj and if he ( xxmaj rukh ) touches anyone ? \" the inspector inquires . xxmaj lugosi xxunk replies , in a way that only xxmaj lugosi could deliver , \" xxmaj they die \" . xxmaj just as xxmaj lugosi could be so off , he could also be more perfect than any actor . xxmaj this is one of those moments . \n"," \n","  xxmaj therefore , xxmaj karloff and xxmaj lugosi 's interactions are all very good as we get the mad antics of xxmaj karloff pared off against the cool logic of xxmaj lugosi . xxmaj karloff would go on to play similar mad scientists many times , however , one wishes xxmaj lugosi would have gotten to play more straight roles like this one . xxmaj he only had one more chance ( xxmaj ninotchka ) . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the xxmaj invisible xxmaj ray is a fun film , and a real treat to the true xxmaj karloff and xxmaj lugosi fans . xxmaj it is one of those films that improves on each viewing , not because it is a masterpiece , but because of the charisma and talent of its ' stars and how this story complements the darker , more horrific pairings they had . xxmaj the special effects , by the always innovative xxmaj john xxmaj fulton , are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate . xxmaj frances xxmaj drake looks as beautiful as she did in xxmaj mad xxmaj love and plays a strong woman , something seldom seen in classic horror films . xxmaj the scene in the end when xxmaj karloff stalks her and she does n't scream is one of the most haunting moments of the film . a terrific , fun film !,xxbos xxmaj leave it to xxmaj xxunk to put on a good show . xxmaj finally he and xxmaj zorak are living their own lives outside of xxmaj xxunk xxmaj ghost xxmaj coast xxmaj to xxmaj coast . i have to say that i love both of these shows a whole lot . xxmaj they are completely what started xxmaj adult xxmaj swim . xxmaj brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000 . xxmaj it may not have been platinum , but his show was really popular to tons of people out there that love xxmaj adult xxmaj swims shows . i have to say that out of all the xxmaj adult xxmaj swim shows with no plot , this has to be the one with the most none plot ever made . xxmaj that is why i like it so much , it is just such a classic in the xxmaj adult xxmaj swim history . i believe this is just such a great show , if you do n't like it . xxmaj hey there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it .,xxbos this is the best sci - fi that i have seen in my 29 years of watching sci - fi . i also believe that xxmaj dark xxmaj angel will become a cult favorite . xxmaj the action is great but xxmaj jessica xxmaj alba is the best and most gorgeous star on xxup tv today .\n","y:

created a very clever action / spy thriller . xxmaj the actors xxmaj donald xxmaj sutherland and especially xxmaj aidan xxmaj quinn gave a top performance . xxmaj what a pity that we couldn´t see xxmaj aidan xxmaj quinn in others movies like this one till now . xxmaj he was simply the best in the role as xxmaj ramirez / xxmaj carlos for what he should have earned the xxmaj oscar . xxmaj the

that voted for this show to continue on ! i will hope for a second , third and who knows how many more episodes ! xxmaj its a really good show , very funny and entertaining !,xxbos xxmaj jennifer xxmaj montgomery 's \" xxmaj art for xxmaj teachers of xxmaj children \" is a stunning , disturbing masterpiece . xxmaj montgomery 's gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking , raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year - old xxmaj jennifer 's seduction of her married boarding - school guidance counselor . xxmaj the scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing xxmaj jennifer ( xxmaj caitlin xxmaj grace mcdonnell ) and xxmaj jennifer 's mother ( actually voiced by xxmaj ruth xxmaj montgomery ) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful i 've ever seen captured on film . xxmaj the lesson ultimately learned here ? \" xxmaj there 's nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art . \" xxmaj well , i would highly recommend this remarkable piece of \" xxmaj art \" for anyone interested in thought - provoking independent cinema .,xxbos xxmaj perhaps one of the first slasher film that came out after xxmaj halloween ( xxmaj although made from xxmaj irwin xxmaj xxunk from xxmaj halloween ) , i must say i honestly found \" xxmaj tourist xxmaj trap \" to be scarier and funner . \" xxmaj tourist xxmaj trap \" is one of those remarkable treats you find every now and then , and are left with the most enjoyable feeling of surprise . xxmaj it was destiny i tell you , but one night i was at my local xxmaj blockbuster ( xxmaj one or xxmaj two months before it went out of business ) , and had nothing to get . xxmaj then i stumble upon this movie , i think huh seems like a laughable b - xxmaj movie , i rent it and took it home , boy was i in for a good scare . \" xxmaj tourist xxmaj trap \" comes off as a bad movie , it definitely has it 's cheesy moments , but in the end you 're having to much fun with it to really care . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the things that impressed me the absolute most , and the things that made this movie one of the scariest ones i 've seen , is number one the setting . a horror movie without a good setting is n't very fun , not here . i just love love love the location , it feels like we can relate to it , it almost feels like we 've been there before . xxmaj which makes it creepier . xxmaj next is the characters , non of them are really stereotypical , and they all have a real personality . xxmaj for example they 're not stoners , alcoholics , or even xxmaj sex obsessed people , they feel like normal young adults . xxmaj plus they look realistic enough , and then their is xxmaj chuck xxmaj connors . xxmaj who gives a great performance as xxmaj mr. xxmaj slausen who we all take an instant liking too because again he 's so real , he feels like that nice guy grandfatherly figure we adore . xxmaj the last , and probably most important thing that makes this movie scary is how they make us ( the audience ) jump half way out of our seats , and turn on the rights , for the right reasons . xxmaj for example most of the time in horror films we mainly just jump because of a sudden change in the music pitch , but in \" xxmaj tourist xxmaj trap \" prepare yourself , that 's not the case . xxmaj with it 's perfect use of lighting , mannequins , and weirdness you feel utterly creeped out . xxmaj plus i love because although they may go a bit over - the - top with some things you still feel like this could happen . xxmaj which is exactly what a horror movie who takes such a ridicules premise should do , and that is make us ( the audience ) feel unsafe and terrified . \n"," \n","  xxmaj overall as far as any major problems go , i have none , only that it 's weirdness may get a little too weird at times . xxmaj however in the end \" xxmaj tourist xxmaj trap \" holds a place near and dear to my heart , for being one of the few horror films to make me turn on the lights and feel unsafe about traveling .,xxbos xxmaj ca n't say this was n't made well . xxmaj at a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes . xxmaj and there is n't the slightest indication he did n't get exactly what he wanted . xxmaj but this is an oddly non - xxmaj hispanic film in the same way xxmaj west xxmaj side xxmaj story was many years ago . xxmaj both the leads , a brother - sister team , are excellent and memorable in their parts . xxmaj the setting , a sort of underground car repair district in xxmaj queens , is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself . xxmaj but there 's something unsatisfying about the key issue in the film , namely , what the sister feels she has to do to get by . i can understand the brother 's reaction , but it just seems a little too easily come by to me . xxmaj the movie seems to suggest that people like these do n't need our help , that they 'll find a way to survive without the usual support systems . i would n't encourage anyone to believe that . xxmaj there would be far more resistance to the choices made here than depicted . xxmaj other than that as an entertainment it works well . xxmaj as an accurate depiction of a culture , not so well , i think .\n","y:
